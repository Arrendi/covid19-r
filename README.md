# covid19-r

This repo links to a collection of analyses on and representations of COVID19 data in R. Inclusion on the list does not mean the analysis was verified by me or that I endorse the findings. It should also be noted that some of the analysis / data might be out of date, so these should not be viewed, by default, as current findings.

I'm collecting them as they get posted online so that I can come back to them later to develop educational examples based on theses data.

Subheadings are in flux as of now, as more analyses get added I might recategorize them. 

If you have examples to add, please open an issue or make a pull request.
